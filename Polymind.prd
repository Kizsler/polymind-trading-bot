1. PRODUCT OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------

PolyMind is an AI-powered automated trading bot designed for prediction markets.
The system focuses on copy trading, trade sniping, and arbitrage across
Polymarket, Kalshi, and Binance price feeds.

The bot continuously monitors selected wallets, market prices, and real-time
crypto data, then uses an AI decision engine to determine if, when, and how
trades should be executed.

--------------------------------------------------
2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
--------------------------------------------------

Prediction markets are often inefficient due to:
- Delayed human reaction times
- Fragmented liquidity across platforms
- Lag between real-world data and market prices
- Emotional and inconsistent manual trading

Advanced traders want a fully automated, intelligent system that can:
- Copy profitable wallets
- React instantly to market movements
- Exploit pricing inefficiencies safely
- Apply consistent risk management

--------------------------------------------------
3. TARGET USERS
--------------------------------------------------

- Advanced Polymarket traders
- Crypto-native traders
- Arbitrage-focused users
- Quant-style retail traders
- DAO or group-managed wallets

--------------------------------------------------
